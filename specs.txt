Core capabilities:
Read a git repo - clone/pull, read files, understand structure
Make changes - edit/create files based on instructions
Submit a PR - commit, push, create pull request via GitHub API or gh CLI
Tools your agent would use:
subprocess or os to run git commands (git clone, git checkout, git commit, etc.)
gh CLI or GitHub API (via PyGithub library) to create PRs
File read/write operations

Basic flow:

User instruction → Agent reads repo → Agent makes changes → Agent commits & pushes → Agent creates PR

Approach options:
Use gh CLI (simpler) - GitHub's official CLI handles auth and PR creation easily
Use GitHub API (more control) - via PyGithub or raw REST calls
